# bookmark-parser

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.25. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

## What is this?

Created a quick parser to do something with chrome's bookmark export. I initially went through each one of my windows (yes I had about 6 open I think) and converted my open tabs/groups into bookmarks then exported those book marks. My plan then is to turn them into markdown so I can import them into Obsidian.

So far though, just parsing the bookmarks.html file and printing out some information.
